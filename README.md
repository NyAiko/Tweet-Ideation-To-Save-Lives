#Tweet Ideation - To save lives

## Problem Statement
- Detecting suicide-related content on social media is challenging but crucial for timely intervention and support. This project addresses the need for an automated system to identify tweets expressing potential suicide risk.

## Solution
- **Classification Model:** Utilizing Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, and the NLTK library, this project aims to build a classification model capable of identifying tweets with potential suicide risk. The goal is to contribute to mental health awareness and support initiatives.

## Technology Used
1. **Python:** Core programming language for its versatility and extensive libraries.
2. **Pandas:** Efficient data manipulation for preparing and analyzing datasets.
3. **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Data visualization for insightful analysis.
4. **Scikit-Learn:** Building and training the classification model.
5. **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** Utilized for advanced natural language processing tasks, enhancing the model's understanding of textual data.

## Model Performance
- **F1 Score (0.90):** The model achieves an impressive F1 score of 0.90, indicating a high level of precision and recall balance. This metric showcases the model's effectiveness in correctly identifying tweets with suicide risk while minimizing false positives and false negatives.
